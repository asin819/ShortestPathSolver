Using Dijsktraâ€™s shortest path algorithm, DFS and BFS searching techniques in Java to compute the shortest path between two points in a graph, while having restrictions of using no traditional data structures and testing using JUnit


The main files are located in src\main while the JUnit test cases are in src\test.
To run the program at the terminal, the main is located in GraphControl.java which is under src\main.
All the data for the graph you wish to work on should be in the folder \testcases.

An example_input and example_output have also been provided. The example_output also shows a working of the program
